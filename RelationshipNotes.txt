Identifying vs Non-Identifying : Cardinality
	Foreign Keys
		Relationhsip is established between two database
		tables when one table has a foreign key that
		references the primary key of another table.
	
	Id Relationship
		Exisitance of a row in a child table depends on a row
		in a parent table.
		Persons table and PhoneNumbers table
	
	Non-Id Relationship
		Primary key of parent table is not a composite key of 
		the child table.
		Persons table and States table
		
	Degree of Relationship
		Number of occurrences in one entity which are associated
		to the number of occurrances in another.
		There are three degrees of relationship
			1:1 One to One
			1:M	One to Many
			M:N	Many to Many
			
			
One to One Relationship
	Only one record on each side of the relationhsip
	Countries and Capital City
	These relationships are rare and difficult to keep 1:1

	Unique Constraints prevent errors changing the relationship
	to a 1:M
	

One to Many Relationship
	Single record in one table is related to multiple records in
	another table

	Brand -> Products
	
	
Many to Many Relationship
	Multiple records in one table related to multiple records
	in another table.
	
	Products <-> Categories
	

Finalize Database Model
	Orders == <3
	1 : M with Customers Table
	M : M with Items
