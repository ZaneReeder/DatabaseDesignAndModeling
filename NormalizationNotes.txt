Normalization
	Design Technique which organizes tables in a manner that reduces
	redundancy and dependency of data
	
	Redundant Data == Useless Data == Same data stored in more than one place
	
	Without Normalizations it becomes difficult to handle and update
		a database without handling data loss
	
	
Normal Forms

	First Normal Form
		Property of a relation table in a relational database such
		that if and only if the domain of each attribute contains
		only atomic values and the calue of each attribute contains
		only a single value from that domain
		
		Axioms
			Each table cell should contain a single ("atomic") value.
			Each record is unique
	
		Split columns to atomic values
		If multiple values can be assigned to a record,
			move them to a new table
		
	
	Second Normal Form
		First Normal Form and
		No non-prime attribute is dependent on any proper subset
		of any candidate key of the table. A non-prime attribute
		of a table is an attribute that is not part of any
		candidate key.
		
		Every non-key attribute of the table is dependent on the
		whole composite primary key.
		
		
	Third Normal Form
		Second Normal Form and
		Every non-prime attribute of R is non-transitively
		dependent on every key of R
		
		Every non-prime attribute of the table must be
		dependent on the primary key.
		There should not be the case that a non-prime attribute
		is determined by another non-prime attribute.
		
		transitive dependancy -
			By A->B && B->C, then A->C
