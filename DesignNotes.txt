		these are the tables.
	
	Objectives
		supports required and ad hoc(unplanned) information retrieval
		tables constructed properly and efficiently
		data integrity is imposed at field, table, and relationship
			levels
		support business rules relevant to the org it is designed
		lend itself to future growth and development
		
	Benefits
		databse structure is easy to modify and maintain
		data is easy to modify
		information is easy to retrieve
		end-user applications are easy to develop and build.
		
	Process
		Art over Science
		Steps
			1 Determine Purpose
			2 Find and Organize information required
			3 Divide the information into tables
			4 Turn information items into columns
			5 Specify Primary Keys
			6 Set up table relationships
			7 Apply the normalization rules
			8 Refine the Design
	
Three Levels of Database Design
	1 Conceptual
	2 Logical
	3 Physical
	
	1 & 2 are called datamodeling
		Abstract design phase
			Entities and Constraints
	
	3 defines datamodel of specific management system
		storage strcuture, file org, and/or indexing
