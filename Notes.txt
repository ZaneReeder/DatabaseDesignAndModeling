What is a Database
	Ancient Mesopotamia
	Tax Data Collection
	Egypt and Rome
	Registries
		Many elements of each citizen
	Catholic Church Registries
	Large Early 20th Century Companies
	Computer Age
		papers -> drives -> files
	
	Official Definition
		A database is an organized collection of Data.
		It is the collection of schemas, tables, queries,
		reports views and other objects. The data is typically
		organized to model aspects of reality in a way that
		supports processes requiring informtaion, such as modelling
		the availability of rooms in hotels in a way that supports
		finding a hotel with vacancies.
	

How Databases Work and Why They Are Important?

	Time Complexity
		Constant
		Linear
		Quadratic
		Logorithmic Time
		
		Binary Self Balancing Trees
			allow searching, access, insertion, and deletions
			in logarithmic time complexity.
		
		N = (m-1)**d
			d=log(N)
		where m is the order, and d is the depth of the tree.
		
		Thus databases index information such that time complexity
		of CRUD is reduced from O(n) to O(logn)
		Indexes
		
Different Type of Databases
	Relational Databases
		SQL, Oracle, IBM, MySQL
		Columns x Rows -> Relational
		Set of Tables -> Schema
		Set of Schemas -> Database
	
	Object Oriented Databases
		Object Relational Mapping

	NoSQL
		Not Only SQL
		Build bookshelves of elements
			narrow down data by pointing to shelf
			then identify words looking for
		MongoDB
		Used by Tech Giants
	
What is Relational Database
	Most Widely Used
	
	Set of Tables linked in meaningful methods
	Row - represents a single item (tuple or record)
	Table - relation in which all rows share common attributes
	Column - unique attribute name
	
	Axioms	
		Each table has unique name
		Each table contains multiple rows
		Each row in table is unique111
		Every table has a key to uniquely identify rows
		Each column has unique attribute name
	
	Primary Key
		Single unique attribute
		ID number - SSN - email address
					Composite Primary Keys
		Foreign Keys
			field whose values are the same as the primary key of
			another table
			Many-to-One
